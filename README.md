## ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project analyzes workforce data from the City of Houston to uncover trends in employee demographics, hiring patterns, departmental staffing, and salary distribution. By visualizing and interpreting key metrics, the project aims to highlight disparities, operational strengths, and areas for strategic improvement. The ultimate goal is to support data-driven decisions that promote inclusivity, efficiency, and long-term workforce planning.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project aims to highlight the following:

*** Understand Workforce Demographics:** Analyze employee race, age, and gender distribution.
*** Identify Hiring Trends:** Pinpoint peak hiring months and overall employee count.
*** Highlight Departmental Structures:** Uncover staffing and payroll distribution across departments.
*** Inform Strategic Workforce Planning:** Provide data insights for future workforce decisions.
*** Empower Stakeholders:** Offer a clear overview of Houston City’s workforce composition.

## DATASET OVERVIEW
The dataset for this project was sourced from the City of Houston, Texas Open Data Site, and it contains detailed entries of employee details, which include:

* Gender
* Race
* Employment Type
* Category
* Gross Pay

## Dataset
_**https://data.houstontx.gov/dataset/payroll/resource/34b676df-4ff1-412a-b8d0-83eda0306388**_

## TOOL USED
Excel was the only tool used for this project, and I used it for Data Cleaning, Analysis, creating Charts, and Dashboard.

## DATA CLEANING
The dataset was already cleaned; I just had to remove some unnecessary columns and do a few calculations, like Average pay and Average age.

## PRE ANALAYSIS
Before building the charts, I conducted a pre-analysis to better understand the dataset and guide my storytelling process. This involved breaking down the data into meaningful components:
*** Project Split:** I categorized the data points into dependent and independent variables, helping me understand the relationships within the dataset and what types of insights could be extracted.
*** Potential Analysis & Questions:** From the grouped variables, I generated key questions that the dataset could answer. This step highlighted the potential insights hidden within the data, even before visualizing it.
*** Preliminary Insights:** By thinking through the questions and data points, I uncovered early insights, which made it easier to shape the narrative and focus the analysis on valuable outcomes.
*** Storytelling:** Once I had a clear understanding of the dataset, I could tell a story from it. By putting together, the relationships between the datapoints and the insights uncovered.
*** Industry & Stakeholders:** This process helped me identify the relevant industry, the stakeholders who would benefit from the analysis, and what success would look like for the organization based on the findings.

## ANALYSIS OF THE CHART
Once I was done with my Pre-Analysis, I started creating my charts. Here is the Analysis for each chart.

### Department With The Most Staff

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57b66137-96a6-47e1-8f7f-d7a3a8d4ea03)

Police staffing dominates at 6,964, significantly dominating all other departments. Fire (4,024) and Houston Public Works (3,983) are the next largest, critical to the city’s safety and infrastructure. The sharp drop to departments like the Airport System (1,408) and Health & Human Services (1,235) reflects a smaller distribution beyond frontline services. The 6,400+ gap between Police and Library (518) reveals potential resourcing imbalances and opportunities for strengthening civic services. Police, Fire, and Public Works collectively lead in staffing, and for good reason. These departments form the backbone of public safety and city functionality.

### Most Employed Gender

The city’s workforce is predominantly male, with men making up over two-thirds of all employees (15,493 vs. 6,877 females). This noticeable gap may reflect the staffing patterns in male-dominated departments like Police and Fire, which have the largest headcounts. The disparity highlights an opportunity for more inclusive hiring strategies to balance gender representation across departments.

### Top Earners By Department

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89156d4f-ab25-49b0-9ffb-a08d36dbf5db)

When it comes to the highest earners in the city, public safety and core services take the lead. The Fire Department tops the list with an impressive $388,939 salary, followed closely by Legal and the Houston Airport System. The Mayor’s Office, Police, and Public Works round out the top earners, each reflecting the city’s investment in essential functions from emergency response and legal oversight to transportation, leadership, and infrastructure. These figures highlight how the city prioritizes roles that directly impact safety, stability, and daily operations.

### Hiring Peaks By Month

Looking at the Hiring by Houston City, a really interesting pattern is spotted. It seems like January is by far the biggest month for hiring, with a massive spike of 7107 new hires compared to the rest of the year. After that initial rush, there’s a significant drop in hiring in February, down to just 1240 new hires. Throughout the rest of the year, the hiring numbers fluctuate a bit, but they generally stay within a narrower range, with a noticeable slump in May with just 789 new hires, which happen to be the month with the least hires, then a bump up around June 1782, new hires, and then another increase towards December 1697, new hires. This suggests that the beginning of the year is a key time for new hires, possibly related to budget cycles or the start of new initiatives.

### Count of Employment Type

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfe6ee65-a1ba-45ba-bf4e-fe1b5bcd36e9)

This chart shows the distribution of employment categories within Houston City. A significant majority of the workforce, constituting 92.12%, are classified as full-time workers. The Temporary employment category represents 4.14% of the total. Part-time positions account for 3.48%, while the Part Time 30 category (employees who work part time and for only 30 hours per week) comprises a minimal 0.26%. This data indicates a strong dominance of full-time employment within the Houston City workforce.

### Count of Employee Age Group

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14ea1813-4052-4641-81de-03f08ef6d80f)

The city’s workforce is predominantly middle-aged, with individuals between 38 and 57 years old making up nearly half of the total population (11,350 out of 22,370). This concentration suggests a mature workforce likely holding many leadership or experienced roles. In contrast, younger adults aged 18–27 are significantly underrepresented (only 1,597 individuals), indicating potential challenges in attracting or retaining younger talent. As older age groups (68+) make up less than 3% of the workforce, succession planning and knowledge transfer will be essential to maintain organizational stability over time.

### Employee Count By Race

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5c47240-88b3-4974-b556-8492af7dbfc1)

The city’s workforce shows notable racial diversity. Black employees constitute the largest group with 7,987 individuals, followed closely by Hispanic/Latino employees (6,385) and White employees (6,085). Asian employees number 1,666, while American Indian employees are the smallest group at 101. The distribution indicates that the majority of employees are from Black, Hispanic/Latino, and White racial backgrounds, with significantly lower representation among Asian and American Indian groups.

## FINAL OBSERVATIONS

* Black employees represent the largest racial group in the city’s workforce with 7,987 individuals, followed by Hispanic/Latino (6,385) and White employees (6,085). Asian (1,666) and American Indian (101) employees have significantly lower representation.
* Hiring volume is highest in January with 7,107 hires, followed by a sharp drop in February (1,240). Moderate fluctuations occur from March to October, with hires ranging between 1,291 and 1,782. December sees another rise to 1,697 hires. This pattern indicates cyclical hiring, possibly tied to fiscal planning.
* The largest employee segments are aged 48–57 (5,679), 38–47 (5,671), and 28–37 (5,069), indicating a predominance of mid- to late-career professionals. Representation declines significantly among 18–27-year-olds (1,597), and further among older age groups: 68–77 (598), 78–87 (37), and 88–97 (3).
* As of February 2025, males account for 69% of the workforce (15,493), while females make up 31% (6,877). This imbalance may reflect gendered staffing patterns in departments like Police and Fire, which have large male-dominated staff counts.
* The Fire Department leads with a total payroll of $388,939, followed by the Legal Department ($340,000), Houston Airport System ($335,000), and the Mayor’s Office ($328,016). Police and Houston Public Works each report joint payrolls of $325,000.
* The Police Department employs the most staff (6,964), followed by the Fire Department (4,024) and Houston Public Works (3,983). Departments such as Airport System (1,408), Health & Human Services (1,235), Parks & Recreation (744), and Library (518) have smaller staffing levels.

### Key Insights

* Male employees make up 69% of the workforce.
* The Fire Department, despite having fewer staff than the Police, has the highest payroll.
* January shows the highest hiring activity.
* The average employee age of 45.59 years suggests a mature workforce.
* Full-time roles are predominant, indicating a preference for long-term employment.
* The average base salary of $74,032.93 suggests competitive pay in line with public sector standards.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

* Our analysis shows underrepresentation of Asians and American Indians in the city workforce. We recommend targeted recruitment partnerships with minority organizations and local job boards to attract diverse talent. Implementing inclusive hiring practices across all departments will help build a more balanced workforce that better reflects our community.
* January shows significant hiring spikes followed by sharp declines. HR should align onboarding resources with these peak periods to ensure smoother transitions. Investigating reasons behind slower hiring months could help balance recruitment throughout the year, reducing resource strain and improving consistency.
* The Fire Department earns significantly higher total payroll despite having fewer staff than other departments, likely due to high-risk roles and overtime. Regular review of pay structures across departments, analysis of overtime patterns, and implementation of performance-based incentives would optimize payroll distribution and reduce budget pressure.
* Police, Fire, and Public Works employ the largest staff contingents, reflecting their essential role in city operations. Smaller departments like Library and Parks & Recreation should be evaluated to ensure adequate public service delivery. Upskilling existing staff and creating inter-departmental support systems could address operational challenges in these smaller teams.
* With most employees in their mid-to-late career, Houston needs robust succession planning and knowledge transfer systems. The limited number of employees in the 18–27 bracket suggests enhancing internship programs, graduate entry roles, and university partnerships. Investing in training programs supporting both upward mobility and generational knowledge exchange will ensure continuity and prevent skill gaps as senior employees retire.
* The 69% male workforce highlights the need for gender-sensitive recruitment. We recommend actively promoting gender equity through inclusive hiring campaigns, women’s leadership development programs, and gender audits in male-dominated roles. Creating a welcoming, flexible work environment will help attract and retain female employees across all departments.

## CONCLUSION

My analysis of Houston’s 22,000+ employees reveals the human foundation behind the city’s operations. Beyond the numbers, I uncovered critical insights about priorities, challenges, and opportunities within Houston’s workforce.

The data shows clear emphasis on public safety and infrastructure through staffing and payroll allocations, while highlighting important growth areas in diversity, age distribution, and gender representation. These findings provide actionable intelligence for city leadership to implement more inclusive recruitment, strategic workforce planning, and equitable compensation practices.

As Houston evolves, so must its approach to human capital. This analysis offers a foundation for decisions that balance operational needs with equity goals and fiscal responsibility with fair compensation.

Houston’s true value lies not in its skyline but in the thousands of individuals who make the city work. Through data-informed workforce management, Houston can better support these employees while continuing to deliver the essential services its residents depend on daily.
